# **My personal retail WoW interface settings**

Set interface variables for my World of Warcraft characters; 
source folder tree starting from folder containing the WoW executable is 

      ./WTF/Account/ACCOUNTNAME/

## NB: Thats one below the WoW launcher.app/.exe

As of today, May 6th 2025, current list of addons installed and whether their enabled resides with 

##     Knoedel on realm Moonglade.

## 2do: 
### Clarify: 
####  - is ./SavedVariables together with Knoedel/Moonglades data qualified to create one universal boilerplate for new chars?
####  - how did I make the minimap disappear?
####  - how do I make it come back w/o the workaround of installing SexyMap just for that? Maybe LeatrixPlus is involved..
